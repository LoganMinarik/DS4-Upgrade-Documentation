# DS4-Upgrade-Documentation
This is my DS4 upgrade documentation with pics

# Hello!
welcome to my guide on how I upgraded my stock DS4 PS4 Pro 055 model

# READ ME FIRST!
# * Disclaimer
* Keep in mind that the first time you open your DS4 (PS4 Pro DualShock) controller:
  * It WILL be hard to open the first time
  * It WILL be easy to snap and break your vibrators. 
  * You MIGHT accidentally damage your trackpad ribbon cable like I did (replacements are dirt cheap in a good way)
  * You MIGHT break your controller if not done carefully
  * I am not held responsible for any damages YOU do to your device by modding it
  * This is only a rough documentation on what I did to mine so others can be more informed on if they want to take right to repair into their own hands
  * This documentation is as of 1/8/206 is in its rough writing period.
